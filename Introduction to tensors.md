## Introduction to tensors
- Tensors are multi dimensional arrays
- Tensor is a container of data where we store almost always numerical data
- Tensors are generalization of matrices to an arbitary number of dimensions
### A tensor is defined by three attributes
- Number of axis or rank (ndim)
- Shape(shape)
- Data type(dtype)
We can obtain the tensor dimension through ndim
- Scalar tensors contain a single number it also called zero dimensional vector
- vector tensor are is also known as 1d vector - 
- 2D vectors
- 3D tensors - pack matrix in an array of matrix
- Mnist data set provides the train and test split for the data
