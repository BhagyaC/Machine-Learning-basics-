## Linear algebra is the mathematics of data
- Linear algebra is undeniably a pillar of machine learning
- Since linear algebra is a huge field to study a breadth first approach is appropriate in the case of applied machine learning
- Read the existing algorithms
- Implement new algorithms described in the paper
- Concisely describe your own methods
- Linear algebra arithmetic
- eg) matrix multiplication and tensor multiplication
### Some intro to tensors
- Tensors helps in the geometry
- Complex geometry - general relativity (space, big bang theory)
- That is like space - time is curved and the universe is expanding
- Einstein field equation are filled with tensors
- Tensor multiplication combines the two geometrical spaces to one complex one
- Tensors are multidimensional arrays
- Tensors has a geometrical meaning in the definision
- So tensors are the object that is invarient under a change of cordinates and it has components that changes in a special predictable way under change of cordinates
- Or Tensors are collection of vectors and covectors collected together using the tensor product
- A covector is a row vector but in a cordination system where the definision is given like one unit length and perpendicular to each other then the transformed column vector is a row vector but in another cases it is not
- So in a unified way the covectors or the row vectors are defined as a fuction of the dot product
