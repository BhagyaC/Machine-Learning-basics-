## Trail / experiment 
- The act that leads to a result with certain probability
## Sample space
- The set of all possible out comes of an experiment
## Event 
- a non empty subset of the sample space

- Basic probability calculation

- As per the definition, if A is an event of an experiment and it contains n outcomes and S is the sample space then
- P(A) = no of out comes of a/ no of outcomes of s
