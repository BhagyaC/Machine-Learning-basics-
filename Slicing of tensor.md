# Slicing the tensor 
- It is the selection of specific layers of the tensor is know as slicing the tensors
- : will give the entire axis
- i:j will we can slice the tensor from i to j-1
- [i:j,:,:] will give the same result
- 14*14 batch of the data [:,14:,14:]
-  First 128 batch is selected as [:128]
- nth batch = 
- 2D - (sample, features) - text documents
- 3D - (sample, timesteps, features) - stock prices
- 4D - (sample , channel ,height ,width ) - mnist
- 5D - (sample ,frames, channel ,height ,width ) - video
